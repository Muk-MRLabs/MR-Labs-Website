            <p className="mb-4">
              Founded in Melbourne in 2015, MR Labs began with a simple mission: to make 
              powerful AI automation accessible to businesses of all sizes. What started as 
              a small consulting firm has grown into a leading automation agency trusted by 
              businesses across Australia and beyond.

            <p className="mb-4">
              Our team combines deep technical expertise with business acumen to deliver 
              solutions that don't just look impressiveâ€”they drive real results for our clients.
            </p>
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Our Mission</h3>
            <p>
              We exist to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI technology and practical 
              business applications. Our mission is to help organizations work smarter, not 
              harder, by implementing intelligent automation that removes friction, 
              reduces costs, and creates new opportunities for growth.
